            During the pandemic I worked at Universal. I have worked at <br>
            most of the attractions but currently am at Transformers: The Ride 3D. <br>
            It's fun pretending to do what technically is my dream job. I have <br>
            thought about joining the Air Force, but only to get to Space Force. <br>
            NASA is my ideal location to be. I am excited for what the future holds.
